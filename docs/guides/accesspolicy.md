# Setting a default access policy for uploads

When data files, metadata documents, and resource maps are uploaded to your repository
through the MetacatUI dataset editor, each upload is assigned a [DataONE Access Policy](https://releases.dataone.org/online/api-documentation-v2.0.1/apis/Types.html#Types.AccessPolicy). Access Policies define who can view, edit, or edit ownership of an object.

To define the default Access Policy of objects uploaded to your repository,
define a [`defaultAccessPolicy` configuration option](../docs/AppConfig.html#defaultAccessPolicy) in the `AppConfig` object.

In your `AppConfig`, set the default access policy via the `defaultAccessPolicy` attribute. The default access policy is an array of literal objects
with the following attributes:
`subject`, `read`, `write`, and `changePermission`.

The values of these attributes will be serialized to the system metadata of each object uploaded via the MetacatUI editor.

This default access policy makes all objects publicly readable:
  ```javascript
  [{
    subject: "public",
    read: true,
    write: false,
    changePermission: false
  }]
  ```

The above access policy will be serialized into the system metadata as:
  ```xml
    <accessPolicy>
      <allow>
        <subject>public</subject>
        <permission>read</permission>
      </allow>
    </accessPolicy>
  ```

#### Examples:
- Make all objects publicly viewable

  ```js
    defaultAccessPolicy: [{
      subject: "public",
      read: true,
      write: false,
      changePermission: false
    }]
  ```
- Make all objects private

  ```js
    defaultAccessPolicy: [{
      subject: "public",
      read: false,
      write: false,
      changePermission: false
    }]
  ```

- Make all objects private but give an administrative group access to view, edit, and edit ownership

  ```js
    defaultAccessPolicy: [{
      subject: "public",
      read: false,
      write: false,
      changePermission: false
    },
    {
      subject: "CN=data-admins,DC=dataone,DC=org", //Your admin group ID/subject
      read: true,
      write: true,
      changePermission: true
    }]
  ```
