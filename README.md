MetacatUI is a client-side web interface for querying Metacat servers and other servers that implement the DataONE REST API.  Currently, it is used as the basis for the [KNB Data Repository](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org), the [NSF Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/), the [DataONE federation](https://search.dataone.org), and other repositories.

MetacatUI is an open source, community project.  We welcome contributions in many forms, including code, graphics, documentation, bug reports, testing, etc.  Use the [discussion list](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacatui/issues) to discuss these contributions with project contributors.

## Installation

### Using MetacatUI with your own Metacat repository
 See the [Metacat documentation](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat) for full installation instructions. In particular, the [`themes` section](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat/blob/master/docs/user/metacat/source/themes.rst) of the Metacat documentation gives installation instructions for using MetacatUI with your Metacat repository.

### Using MetacatUI locally with a remote Metacat repository
To run MetacatUI, you will need to first install a web server such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/). The following instructions are for Mac OS X. Apache comes pre-installed on Mac OS X.

#### Step 1. Set up Apache
- Choose a location from which to serve *all* your Apache website files. A good location is `/Users/{username}/Sites`
- Make a subdirectory in `~/Sites` specifically for MetacatUI. The default directory name for MetacatUI is `metacatui`.

  ```
  mkdir ~/Sites/metacatui
  ```

- Configure Apache to serve files from your `Sites` directory by opening `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` and changing the `DocumentRoot` pathname. Example:

    ```
    DocumentRoot "/Users/walker/Sites"
    <Directory "/Users/walker/Sites/metacatui">
    ```

#### Step 2. Configure a VirtualHost in Apache for MetacatUI
- First, create a backup of the default httpd-vhosts.conf file:

  ```
  sudo cp /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf.bak
  ```

- Clear out the example VirtualHost configuration if it is there, and add a VirtualHost for the `~/Sites/metacatui` directory (make sure `walker` is replaced with your username):

  ```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot "/Users/walker/Sites"
      ServerName metacatui.localhost
      ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/metacatui-error_log"
      CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/metacatui-access_log" common
      
      # Allow encoded slashes in URLs so encoded identifiers can be sent in MetacatUI URLs
      AllowEncodedSlashes On
      
     <Directory "/Users/walker/Sites/metacatui">
      FallbackResource /metacatui/index.html
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  ```

The FallbackResource configuration is how MetacatUI is able to use real pathnames like `/data/page/2` for a single-page application.

The FallbackResource directive requires your Apache version to be `2.2.16` and above. If you're using the earlier versions of Apache, you'll require `mod_rewrite` in your configuration. Example:

  ```
    <Directory "/Users/walker/Sites/metacatui">
    ...
    ...

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
    </IfModule>
    </Directory>
  ```

- Create a host name for `metacatui.locahost`. First, open `/etc/hosts`:

  ```
  sudo vi /etc/hosts
  ```

- Add `metacatui.localhost` to the bottom of the file. **Be careful not to change any other part of this file!**:

  ```
  # metacatui local site
  127.0.0.1 metacatui.localhost
  ```

- Save your `/etc/hosts` changes and start (or restart) Apache:

  ```
  sudo apachectl start
  ```

#### Step 3. Configure MetacatUI
- Download the [latest MetacatUI release .zip file](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacatui/releases) and unzip it
- Open `src/index.html` in a text editor and change the following values:
    - Set the `data-theme` to your chosen theme name, e.g. `default`, `knb`, `arctic`.
    - Set `data-metacat-context` to match the Metacat directory name of the remote Metacat you will be using. For example, Metacat is installed at https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/knb so the `data-metacat-context` would be set to `knb`. Most Metacat installations are at `metacat` since that is the default.
    - Optional: Replace `YOUR-GOOGLE-MAPS-API-KEY` with your [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to enable the Google Map features of MetacatUI. If no API key is given, MetacatUI will still work, it just will not include the map features.
- Open `src/js/models/AppModel.js`, or if using a theme other than the default theme, `src/js/themes/{theme name}/models/AppModel.js` and change the following values:
    - Set `baseUrl` to the URL where the remote Metacat is (e.g. `https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu`)
    - Set `d1CNBaseUrl` to the URL of the DataONE Coordinating Node that the Metacat Member Node is a part of. (e.g. the Member Node `urn:node:mnTestKNB` is in the `urn:node:cnStage` Coordinating Node, so this attribute would be set to `https://cn-stage.test.dataone.org/`)

- *Note: If you installed MetacatUI somewhere other than the location in step 2 above:* you will need to change the `loader.js` pathname in `index.html` and the `MetacatUI.root` pathname in `loader.js` to the custom location where MetacatUI is located. For example, if you installed MetacatUI at root instead of in a `metacatui` subdirectory, your `loader.js` pathname in `index.html` would be `/loader.js` and `MetacatUI.root` would be `/`.

#### Step 4. Move MetacatUI files to Apache
- Move the MetacatUI application code to the directory we chose in Step 2.

    ```
    cp -rf metacatui-2.0.0/src/* ~/Sites/metacatui/
    ```

- Open a web browser and navigate to `metacatui.localhost/metacatui` and your MetacatUI application should be ready to go!

### Using MetacatUI locally with a remote DataONE Coordinating Node

#### Step 1.
- Follow Step 1-2 above to configure the Apache web server on your local machine.

#### Step 2. Configure MetacatUI
- Download the [latest MetacatUI release .zip file](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacatui/releases) and unzip it
- Open `src/index.html` in a text editor and change the following values:
    - Set the `data-theme` to `dataone`.
    - Remove the value of `data-metacat-context` since DataONE CN URLs do not have a metacat directory
    - Optional: Replace `YOUR-GOOGLE-MAPS-API-KEY` with your [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to enable the Google Map features of MetacatUI. If no API key is given, MetacatUI will still work, it just will not include the map features.
- Open `src/js/themes/dataone/models/AppModel.js` and change the following values:
    - Set `baseUrl` and `d1CNBaseUrl` to the URL where the remote DataONE CN is (e.g. `https://cn-stage.test.dataone.org`)
- Open `src/loader.js` and set the value for the following property:
    - Set `MetacatUI.root` based on the location off of its top directory. Example:
        - If the source code is located at `~/Sites/metacatui` (as detailed in Step 1), set the `MetacatUI.root = "/metacatui"`.

#### Step 3. Move MetacatUI files to Apache
- Move the MetacatUI application code to the directory we chose in Step 1.

    ```
    cp -rf metacatui-2.0.0/src/* ~/Sites/metacatui/
    ```

- Open a web browser and navigate to `metacatui.localhost/metacatui` and your MetacatUI application should be ready to go!

## Development

### Running

While developing on MetacatUI, it's necessary to run a web server of some sort in order for the application to work completely.
You can set up a web server such as Apache as described above in the Installation section but MetacatUI also comes with a simple [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) application that uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Pre-requisites:

1. [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `npm`
2. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com): Install with `npm install express`

Steps:

1. Set up `index.html` and `loader.js` as described above in the Installation section.
2. Run the folowing commands in a terminal:

```sh
# from this repository's top level directory
npm install express
node server.js
```

Now MetacatUI should be serving at http://localhost:3000 and you should be able to visit it in your web browser.
