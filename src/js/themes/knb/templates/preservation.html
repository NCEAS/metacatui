                    Data Preservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data preservation is critically important to the KNB. We recognize that data
                    preservation is difficult, both for technical and non-technical reasons.
                    We have developed this data preservation plan to be explicit about how the
                    KNB ensures the long-term preservation of the data entrusted to the
                    repository. Key to this plan is our belief that no single organization can
                    possibly provide sufficient institutional stability to guarantee multi-decadal
                    preservation, and that partnerships among committed archives are necessary for
                    successful data longevity. The guiding principles for our preservation plan
                    follow.

                            The primary mission of the KNB is data preservation and data access.
                            High-quality data management is essential to data preservation.
                            Data are managed following best practice for systems administration
                            at UCSBâ€™s North Hall Data Center (NHDC), which complies with a
                            subset of Tier 1 ANSI/TIA Data Center Standards.

                        <p>
                            Wherever possible, we utilize and encourage the use of open
                            standards for representation of data and metadata, and for
                            provisioning of services. Metadata are managed in the open
                            Ecological Metadata Language (EML), and we encourage researchers
                            to provide data using open data formats such as ASCII CSV for
                            tabular data and open formats for imagery. Open formats support
                            accessibility of the data in the future even in the face of
                            large software changes. In addition, the repository supports
                            open access via the
                            <a href="<%= MetacatUI.root %>/api">DataONE REST API</a>
                            for external groups to be able to access all components of the system.

                        Replicate data and metadata.
                        <p>
                            All metadata and data are replicated at geographically distinct
                            locations including DataONE replication nodes. Replication
                            is automated, and occurs any time that a change to any file in
                            the system is made. Replication assures that data and metadata
                            remain available even in the case of unplanned local system
                            outages (such as a regional-scale fire or earthquake event),
                            and provides for higher-performance access to data from
                            multiple replica sites.

                                Force11 Data Citation guidelines

                            every version of every object in the system is assigned a
                            unique identifier which is used to track that version of the object
                            and relate it to earlier versions. For data packages, a
                            <a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite DOI identifier</a> is
                            assigned and registered upon publication. All
                            updates to objects are tracked, and old versions of data packages
                            and data objects remain accessible even after an update, ensuring
                            that any citations to the original versions of data can continue to
                            be resolved to exactly the version of the data that was cited.
                            Older versions of data packages are clearly marked, making it easy
                            to navigate to the most recently updated versions, and search
                            systems point users to the most recent version.

                        Frequent Auditing.
                        <p>
                            All data, metadata, and other objects in the system are provided 
                            with a checksum that can be used to validate that the contents 
                            of the object have not changed over time. The KNB participates 
                            in the DataONE federation, which audits all objects to ensure 
                            that the current copy of the object matches the original 
                            authoritative copy. In addition, DataONE checks all replica copies 
                            to ensure that they continue to persist and have matching 
                            checksums. This periodic auditing ensures that accidental 
                            content corruption due to disk, network, and human error are 
                            detected and remedied in a timely manner.

                <h3>Wind-down Plan</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to this preservation plan, we recognize that over long time 
                    periods spanning many decades, it is extremely difficult to predict and 
                    sustain funding for single institutions. Our replication policy ensures 
                    high-availability during normal operations, but also provides security 
                    should investment in data archival wane. Should the main KNB fail to 
                    be sustained, then the management of the KNB will work with our 
                    partnering institutions to ensure that the archival replicas that they 
                    hold continue to be preserved and available to the scientific community. 
                    This will likely mean that another DataONE member node would become 
                    the authoritative holder of the data until a time when continued support can
                    be obtained to re-establish operations.

                <p>
                    Primary systems are maintained at the 
                    <a href="https://www.it.ucsb.edu/north-hall-data-center">North Hall Data Center</a>,
                    which complies with a subset of the Tier 1 ANSI/TIA Data Center 
                    Standards. Networking at 10GbE is via redundant connections to the 
                    public Internet and Internet2 through the CalREN2 and CENIC networks. Room 
                    UPS power backed by an emergency generator is available up to the 
                    162kW capacity of the data center. Primary cooling capacity is derived from 
                    the campus chilled water loop. With the campus chilled water loop subject 
                    to regional power outages, secondary emergency cooling is from two 
                    locally installed chillers with a total 60 Tons of capacity. When NHDC is 
                    on emergency power, the emergency chilled water is used for the UPS room, 
                    AHU 5 (campus networking) and chilled water distribution to advanced 
                    rack cooling technologies. All racks are mounted on zone 4 ISO-Base 
                    platforms for seismic protection. The NHDC is subject to the 
                    environmental conditions of the campus and the region. Planned 
                    outages involving all equipment within NHDC will be uncommon, but 
                    occasionally necessary for certain types of maintenance activity. 
                    During such outages, data and metadata from the KNB will still be 
                    available via our replica holdings, but data submissions will be delayed 
                    until normal operations are restored.
