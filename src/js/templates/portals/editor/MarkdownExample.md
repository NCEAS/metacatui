# Level 1 Header

Markdown is a simple way to format text.

## Level 2 Header

For example, *this text will be italic* and **this text will be bold**. Here is a link to [DataOne](https://www.dataone.org), and here is an equation written using the TeX language: $$ y =X\beta + \epsilon $$.

Add an image like so: ![DataOne logo](https://www.dataone.org/sites/default/files/d1-logo-v8_aligned_left.png)

Show in-line code using `single backticks`, or show it as a separate block using triple backticks:

```r
my_string <- "Check out the code I wrote"
print(my_string)
```

Here is how to make a table:
| Tables | Are | Cool  |
| ------ | --- | ----- |
| x      | a   | $1600 |
| y      | b   |   $12 |
| z      | c   | $1600 |

The following is an unordered list:
* List item a
* List item b
* List item c
    * You can create nested lists by indenting list items by four spaces.
    * Sub-item 2

This is a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

To quote some text, just start a line with a `>` character. In the words of Grace Hopper:
> information is more valuable than the hardware which processes it.

You can even add emojis :smile:!
